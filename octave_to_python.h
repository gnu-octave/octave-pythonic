    \brief Conversion of data values from GNU Octave to Python

    The functions in this file define the translation of GNU Octave
    values to Python objects using the Boost.Python library and
    the Octave/C++ API.

    This project is currently derived from an earlier project called
    Pytave that allowed Python to call Octave functions on an
    embedded Octave interpreter. The bulk of the project is in the
    code to convert between Octave and Python data types, so most of
    that is reusable. As a side goal, we may continue to maintain the
    Python wrapper around Octave and incorporate that into Octave as
    well, so that Octave can provide its own native Python module.
