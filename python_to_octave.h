/*! \file python_to_octave.h
    \brief Conversion of data values from Python to GNU Octave

    The functions in this file define the translation of Python
    objects to GNU Octave values using the Boost.Python library and
    the Octave/C++ API.

    Features and capabilities of Octave's Python interface include:

    - Import and call Python modules and functions from the Octave interpreter

    - Automatically convert basic Octave and Python types seamlessly between the two environments

    - \todo Be able to handle arbitrary unknown Python objects (print their repr, store in a variable, pass back in to a Python function)

    -  \todo Store references to Python functions (and other "callables") and be able to call them as if they were function handles
