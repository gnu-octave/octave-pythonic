	"""Executes an Octave function called funcname.

	The function is set to return nargout values. Returned values
	are stored in a tuple. If the nargout argument is less than 0,
	an empty tuple is returned.

	M-files are searched for in the Octave path.

	See also the Octave documentation for the builtin Octave function
	feval.

	Type conversions
	****************
	
	The following type conversions are supported:

	Python to Octave
	================
	
	Objects:
		int (32-bit)        int32
		float (64-bit)      double
		str                 string
		dict                struct
		list                cell
		
	Numeric Array:
		UBYTE, SBYTE,       matrix of correct type
		USHORT, SHORT,      -''-
		UINT, SINT,         -''-
		LONG,               -''-
		DOUBLE              -''-

	All other objects causes a pytave.ObjectConvertError to be
	raised. This exception inherits TypeError.
	
	Octave to Python
	================
	
	Scalar values to objects:
		bool                bool
		real scalar         float (64-bit)
		any string*         str
		struct              dict
		cell*               list

		* Cell arrays must be one-dimensional (row vector) and
                  character matrices must only have one row.  Any
                  other form will raise a ValueConvertError.
		
	Matrix values to Numeric arrays:
		int64               LONG
		int32, uint32       INT, UINT
		int16, uint16       SHORT, USHORT
		int8, unint8        SBYTE, UBYTE

	All other values causes a pytave.ValueConvertError to be
	raised. This exception inherits TypeError.

	Errors
	******

	Octave runtime errors are encapsulated into
	pytave.OctaveError exceptions, base class RuntimeError.

	"""

	return _pytave.feval(nargout, funcname, arguments)

def eval(nargout, code, silent=True):

	"""Executes a given Octave code.

	The expression is expected to return nargout values. Returned
	values are stored in a tuple. If the nargout argument is less
	than 0, an empty tuple is returned.

	All normal scope and function search rules apply. If silent is
	true (default), the result is not auto-printed, as if a
	semicolon was appended. Otherwise, auto-printing is enabled.

	See also the Octave documentation for the builtin Octave
	function eval.

	For information about returned value conversion, see
	pytave.feval.

	Errors
	******

	If the code cannot be parsed, a pytave.ParseError exception
	occurs.

	Octave runtime errors are encapsulated into pytave.OctaveError
	exceptions, base class RuntimeError.

	If the resulting values cannot be converted, a
	pytave.ValueConvertError is raised. This exception inherits
	TypeError.
