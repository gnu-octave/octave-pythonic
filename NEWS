Version 0.1-bzr 

* Added functionality for one-row cell arrays.  The Python list is
  converted to a one-row cell array and vice versa.

* Added functionality for structs.  The Python distionary is converted
  to a Octave struct and vice versa.  The implementation tries to be
  as true as possible to Octave's struct constructor.
