Version 0.1 bzr 

* Added functionality for one dimensional cell arrays. Python list represents
a one dimensional cell array. Pytave will throw an exception if a cell array 
has higher dimensions. 

* Added functionality for structs, a Octave struct is represented by a python
dictionary. The implementation tries to be as true as possible to Octaves 
struct constructor.
